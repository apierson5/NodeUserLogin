# Installation

1. To install, run the following command in git bash in your perferred working directory:

`git clone https://github.com/apierson5/NodeUserLogin`

2. Next, in the created directory (you should see a package.json file), run:

`npm install`

3. Start the express server by running:

`npm run devStart`

Assuming you have Mongodb installed on your local machine, you should now be able to access all of the endpoints.
